The Search for the Secret Sapphire

A point-and-click adventure puzzle game (with a twist)... Lost in a haunted mansion without a hope of escape, the only way out is in. Will you find the Secret Sapphire and cure the curse? 

DEV'S NOTE: The above assumes that you are able to start the game. If the start-button breaks, the HELP BOT should be able to assist you. That shouldn't happen though. Probably. 

------------------------SPOILERS BELOW------------------------

The point-and-click adventure actually takes place inside of the menu of "The Search for the Secret Sapphire". Your goal is to fix the start button and finally get to play the game. 


The game is actually a secret game within the menu of another game. Additionally, you need to solve puzzles and find all of the secrets within the menu maze to get the pieces of the START button back together and play the game!
